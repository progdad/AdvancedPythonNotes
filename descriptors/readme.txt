The "Descriptors" topic is relevant to operator overload,
and at first the topic has been putted to ../operatorsOvload directory,
but then I've decided to separate the topic about descriptors out of ../operatorsOvload,
because it's a big, important and difficult topic

All the examples and explanations are taken from the official documentation.
